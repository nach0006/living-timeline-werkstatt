# Living Timeline - Project for Werkstatt
This project proposes a subtle projection installation designed for Werkstatt’s reopening event. The installation activates four framed photographs placed horizontally on a wall upstairs. Through light and timing, the projection tells the story of Werkstatt’s history, emphasizing that while the space is reopening and renewed, its past remains essential to its identity. The projection functions as a quiet narrative element rather than a dominant visual feature, respecting the social and conversational nature of the event.
